# Global-Lithological-Map-Visualization-in-3D
This project visualizes the Global Lithological Map (GLiM) on a 3D interactive globe using R. The visualization provides an engaging way to explore different lithological classifications worldwide based on GLiM data.

Overview:
  The Global Lithological Map (GLiM) is a comprehensive dataset representing Earth's surface lithology. 
  This project utilizes threejs and terra packages in R to render an interactive 3D globe where:

  Different lithology types are represented by distinct colors.
  Users can rotate, zoom, and explore lithological data across the globe.
  A legend provides a reference for lithology classification.
  This project is ideal for geologists, remote sensing experts, and GIS enthusiasts interested in exploring lithological patterns globally.

Features:
âœ… Interactive 3D Globe â€“ Rotate, zoom, and explore lithological data effortlessly.
âœ… Color-coded Lithology â€“ Each lithology type is visually distinct for easy interpretation.
âœ… Custom Legend â€“ A floating legend describes each lithology class and its color.
âœ… Full-Screen Mode â€“ The visualization is designed for immersive exploration.

Libraries Used
This project utilizes the following R libraries:

  terra â€“ For raster data processing and manipulation.
  threejs â€“ For rendering the interactive 3D globe.
  htmltools â€“ For embedding the visualization in an HTML page.
  
Data Source:
  The lithology data is sourced from GLiM (Global Lithological Map) and downloaded from:
  ðŸ”— GLiM Data Repository: https://www.cen.uni-hamburg.de/en/about-cen/news/2017-02-27-lithologischer-globus.html
  The dataset provides lithological classifications with 16 categories, including sedimentary, volcanic, plutonic, metamorphic, and unconsolidated materials.
  
Conclusion:
  This project successfully demonstrates how 3D geospatial visualization can be used to explore global lithology. The interactive approach provides a more intuitive way to analyze lithological distributions compared to traditional 2D maps.

Key insights include:
  Tectonic Plate Influence â€“ Lithology is strongly correlated with tectonic activity, particularly along plate boundaries.
  Sedimentary Dominance â€“ Large regions are dominated by sedimentary formations, particularly in continental interiors.
  Volcanic and Plutonic Hotspots â€“ Areas of volcanic activity, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire, are clearly distinguishable.
  This visualization can be further enhanced by integrating additional geospatial datasets, such as earthquake occurrences, soil composition, and mineral resources, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's geological structure.
